# AircraftDesign
This project was developed as the culminating capstone for UC Irvine’s MAE 159 Aircraft Design course. The goal was to design a 210-passenger, Class II commercial transport aircraft and analyze its performance across a variety of material and engine configurations. The design was developed to meet a comprehensive set of mission and regulatory constraints, including range, passenger capacity, maximum takeoff weight, center of gravity limits, and fuel efficiency.

Our approach involved evaluating three structural configurations — full aluminum, full composite, and a hybrid aluminum-composite structure — across both conventional and advanced engine types. This resulted in a total of six distinct design cases, each requiring detailed analysis and modeling. The project included mission-based performance simulation, weight estimation, center of gravity analysis, interior layout (LOPA), and full aircraft geometry development using SolidWorks.

The objective of this project was to design a complete 210-passenger commercial aircraft and evaluate the structural and performance trade-offs between aluminum, composite, and hybrid material configurations. The design process involved optimizing the aircraft layout to meet mission requirements while analyzing key performance metrics such as Direct Operating Cost (DOC), Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC), Takeoff Gross Weight (TOGW), and fuel burn. We developed full 3-view drawings, performed CG and structural load analysis, sized fuel tanks, and assessed the manufacturability of each configuration. The goal was to determine the optimal design based on technical performance, economic efficiency, and practical feasibility.
