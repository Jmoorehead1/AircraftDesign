# AircraftDesign
This independently developed capstone project was completed as part of UC Irvineâ€™s MAE 159 Aircraft Design course. I designed a 210-passenger Class II commercial transport aircraft and evaluated its performance across six structural-engine combinations. The configurations included aluminum, composite, and hybrid structural materials, each paired with both conventional and advanced engine types. The design process adhered to mission constraints such as range, fuel capacity, takeoff weight, and cost efficiency. I modeled the full aircraft geometry using SolidWorks and performed detailed structural, aerodynamic, and mission-based analyses.

The primary objective was to assess the technical and economic trade-offs between the different structural configurations. I created six complete aircraft designs and conducted performance evaluations using Direct Operating Cost (DOC), Takeoff Gross Weight (TOGW), Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC), and total fuel burn. Using a combination of MATLAB scripts, mission planning spreadsheets, and SolidWorks layouts, I developed full 3-view drawings, CG analysis, interior layout (LOPA), and load breakdowns to determine the optimal configuration based on performance and manufacturability.

The composite structure outperformed aluminum and hybrid designs across nearly all performance metrics. The fully composite aircraft achieved a 4.1% reduction in TOGW and recorded the lowest DOC and PAXDOC values. The final deliverables included a comprehensive 50+ page report with trade studies, aircraft layouts, and supporting technical analysis, all completed independently using MATLAB, Excel, and SolidWorks.
